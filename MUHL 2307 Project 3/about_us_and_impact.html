        <h2>About Us: </h2>
        <p>Everyone is welcome in the Chromatic Harmony Festival! In this event, every one not only has the 
            chance to experience music from around the world, but also the music genres produced through 
            cultural fusions. Artists from different parts of the world will gather at this event to 
            express themselves and display their music that was born from the unity between multiple 
            cultures. In music, different multiple genres are represented by different colors. 
            For example, pop can be represented with the color pink, while jazz and blues are represented 
            by the color blue. However when we combine these different genres or “colors,” we are able to 
            create new and sometimes beautiful shades of colors, hence the name of the festival. 
            Another reason why this festival is created is that it not only allows artists to display their
             music inspired from multiple cultures, but it also allows some artists to spread their message 
             and encourage change in their countries.. Some of these artists come from countries that are 
             currently in conflict, whether it is caused by war, poverty, or discrimination. While they
              are representing their genre of music in this festival, it also gives the opportunity for 
              these artists to spread their message to raise awareness to these issues and encourage 
              change to improve not only their lives, but also the lives of others who are suffering 
              through something similar.</p>

        <h2>Impact: </h2>
        <p>The purpose of this festival is to highlight the impact of globalization through migration 
            and the technology to the current day. For most of history, most of globalization has happened 
            due to immigration either through forced migration due to conflict or through people who are 
            currently trying to find a better life outside of their home country. For example, several 
            European countries such as Great Britain and Spain both had influence in the development of 
            \countries around the world. Even after they are no longer influenced by other countries,
             these cultures are still evolving by having other immigrants either voluntary or 
             non-voluntary, like slavery. However, ever since the rise of technology such as radio, tv, 
             and even the internet has facilitated globalization, by allowing people to experience 
             different cultures without having to leave the comfort of their home. This type of 
             globalization has allowed for different cultures to integrate a lot quicker than the last 
             thousand years. However, sometimes globalization has led to negative effects, as some cases 
             have led to the cultures being suppressed like Israel and Palestine, to which other parts were 
             used to try to counter this, like Palestinian hip hop. However different parts of globalization 
             have also changed to positive changes, such as giving others a sort of a lifeline when they 
             feel like they are isolated in their home country alone. Overall, the changes and impacts 
             caused by all of this are highlighted in this festival. The artists selected for this festival 
             represent the different aspects and effects of globalization. While some of these artists have 
             been directly affected or benefitted from the effects, other artists have also taken advantage 
             of globalization as well to create something new and beautiful. This in turn, will create new 
             aspects of each of their cultures contributing to globalization. In this festival we want to 
             bring awareness to the changes that appeared as a result of this phenomenon. Throughout this 
             festival, we also hope to encourage others to notice the effects of globalization present in
              their own culture and bring some appreciation to some of the changes, no matter if they are 
              positive or negative.</p>
