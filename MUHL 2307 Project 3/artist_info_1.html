            <h2>Cultural Context:</h2>
            <p>Throughout most of the most recent years, European music hase been gaining popularity due to the combination of both European immigration to other countries
                and the use of media such as the Eurovision Song contest. According to Johan Fornas, “The event is a unified official ritual organized by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) 
                and at the same time stages a number of individual songs selected by national audiences and therefore representing a range of different stylistic and regional approaches.” 
                These methods have allowed not only several countries to express their music all over Europe, but also to different continents around the world such as North and South America, 
                Asia, and even as far as Oceana. These have allowed European music to be further integrated as cultures within and outside of Europe, as more and more people are exposed.</p>

            <h2>Artist Biography</h2>
            <p>Marcus and Martinus are a Norwegian dance-pop duo that consists of twin brothers Marcus and Martinus Gunnarsen, who rose to fame after winning the 11th season of Melodi Grand Prix Junior 
                when they were only 10 years old. Throughout most of their career they became teen idols, rising to fame in European countries such as Sweden, with the internet facilitating their rise to fame. 
                In an Interview, Marcus states “our music has done very well, we have I don’t even know how many streams we’ve done together but it’s a lot with all our music, we have done music for like 10 years 
                and we’ve done a lot of things not (many) people our age have done.” In 2024, they are currently representing Sweden in the Eurovision song contest with their song “Unforgettable,” 
                in which they hope to snag another win for Sweden and sing in the festival.</p>
