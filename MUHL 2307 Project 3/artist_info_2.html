        <h2>Cultural Context:</h2>
        <p>Since 1949, Israel and Palestine have been in constant conflict, ever since the Jewish first arrived onto the land and removed a lot of Palestinians away from their home.
             Ever since then, Israel has been using military forces to not only push the Palestinians into even smaller territories, but also to control the population by 
             conducting random searches and attacking the Palestinian population. For most of history, Palestine was almost completely wiped from most of the world's interactions 
             until they discovered American hip-hop. According to Sunaria Maira, “If hip hop was described as "the Black CNN'' by Chuck D of Public Enemy, suggesting its role as 
             a tool for sharing news of the social and political realities of urban, disadvantaged youth of color since the 1970s (Rose 1994; Forman 2002), it is possible to argue 
             that today, hip hop has become the "Palestinian Al Jazeera" (knowing what we know about CNN)!” As a result, several artists have been using Palestinian hip-hop as a 
             way to bring light to the current problems present in Palestine and to encourage change and equality.</p>

        <h2>Artist Biography</h2>
        <p>Shadia Mansour is a Palestinian hip hop artists who was born in South London in the UK. Growing up, she and her family participated in Palestinian protests, 
            protesting police and military brutality from Israel to Palestinian citizens. She was also exposed to Palestinian culture from both of her parents, 
            who were forced to flee Palestine due to an increase in violence. In 2003, she started her career in Palestinian hip hop in order to protest peacefully, 
            which allowed her to gain recognition in not only Palestine, but also in the US and Europe as well. In an interview with the Cultures of Resistance network, 
            Mansour states “In terms of defending our identity… our culture, our traditions [are] probably the strongest weapons we have today. That’s part of the 
            nonviolent resistance that we’re all playing a role in.” As Shadia advances in her career, she hopes that her music will not only bring awareness to 
            the inequality between Israel and Palestine, but to also bring change to her country.</p>
