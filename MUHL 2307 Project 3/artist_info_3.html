        <h2>Cultural Context:</h2>
        <p>Within these last few decades there has been an increase in conflict between the Australian conservatives and the LGBTQ+ communities, 
            as LGBTQ+ acceptance has started to increase throughout the country. According to Douglas Ezzy, “The number of 18 to 25 year old people 
            who identify as LGBTQ+ has risen dramatically in the last 10 years, from 3 to 6% in 2012 to 13 to 14% in 2020.” Because acceptance has 
            increased throughout Australia, more and more young people are comfortable in coming out, especially with the access of the internet, 
            which gives them a safe space to not only express their sexuality, but also their true selves as well. Many of these young individuals 
            have started gaining the courage by not only participating in supportive forums, but also being exposed to music and cultures outside of Australia.</p>

        <h2>Artist Biography</h2>
        <p>Sheldon Riley Hernandez or Sheldon Riley is an Australian singer who started off his career doing singing competition shows such as Australian 
            versions of X-Factor and the Voice, and America’s got Talent. Growing up, he was exposed to artists outside of Australia and became interested 
            in the Eurovision song contest. There he was exposed to artists such as Conchita Wust, an artist and drag queen who performs in their drag persona, 
            as well as others such as Amy Winehouse and Lady Gaga. In 2022, he represented Australia in the Eurovision Song Contest with the single “Not the Same,” 
            which is one of his many songs that reflect on his experiences and struggles in his childhood. Throughout his entire career, he has been very open to 
            the struggles he faced not only hiding his sexuality and aspergers, but also managing his struggles with his identity. In an interview with AU Review, 
            Riley states that “So for me, this constant fight with myself, if I am myself, am I going to be liked or not? That kind of stereotypical, 
            obvious factor of it, but then also, will I like myself as well when I do come out to the world as who I am?” Throughout his career, 
            he is discovering more and more of himself, which is improving not only his performances, but his career as a whole.</p>
