        <h2>Cultural Context:</h2>
        <p>Since the development of modern Brazilian culture, many cultures from different ethnic groups present have been integrated. 
            According to Karina Maldonado-Mariscal, “During this (1960-1999, after the end of a military dictatorship), 
            Brazil strengthened citizenship through the participation of popular organizations and NGOs, which illustrates important progress for democracy, 
            education, and civil rights in the country.” After these changes, many minority groups such as Native Americans and Africans as well as outside cultures, 
            such as their economy, political, and socially. However, while there is an incentive for equality, many minority groups are unfortunately not that well off as others, 
            leaving for most of them to settle in the ghetto area up the mountains in Rio de Janeiro. However, it is around these areas where most cultures integrate and combine.</p>

        <h2>Artist Biography</h2>
        <p>Isabella Cristina Correia de Lima Lima or IZA is a Brazilian singer, songwriter, and dancer who was born in Rio de Janero on September 3rd, 1991. 
            Growing up, she struggled with racism throughout her entire childhood due to her family being black in a neighborhood full of lighter skinned people. 
            IZA states in an interview, “I was the only Black person. I remember walking into a restaurant and people staring at us, I was like, 
            'Mom, why are people looking at me that much?' And she was like, 'Girl, it is because you are so gorgeous. People can't take it. 
            They are looking at you because you're really cute.' I was like, ‘Oh, my gosh. I'm so gorg, yes!’ But when you get older you realize 
            people treat you differently because of the color of your skin." As she grew up, she started to gain an interest in music, 
            eventually abandoning her career in Advertisement and went to purse music in Youtube. This eventually led to her being signed to a record label in 2016.</p>
