        <h2>Cultural Context:</h2>
        <p>Throughout these last few decades, Europe has faced an influx of immigrants from surrounding continents and countries such as the Middle East, 
            Russia, and Africa. According to Mark Almond, “by the end of July 1992, as many as three million people who used to live in Yugoslavia had 
            been uprooted by the war… (and) refuge in Germany, while tens of thousands have settled in Austria, Hungary, and even distant Sweden.” 
            Almond also states “The relatively positive experience of Germany and Switzerland with their "guest-workers" from Turkey suggests a possible alternative.” 
            Based on both of these quotes, most of these immigrants are leaving most of their home countries for a variety of reasons, including war and job opportunities. 
            As a result, many European countries have a huge population of foreign workers such as refugees. This has led to the integration of these cultures, including music.</p>

        <h2>Artist Biography</h2>
        <p>Luca Hanni is a Swiss singer and dancer who was born in Bern, Switzerland and had an interest in music ever since he was a child, 
            stating “For me it was clear very early that I want to do something with music in my life. I grew up in a musical family. 
            I have been in drum lessons in kindergarten, followed by piano, guitar and singing lessons. Music always was and still is my 
            absolute passion and definitely is a really important part of my life.” In 2012, he rose to fame by becoming the first non-German 
            to win Deutschland sucht den Superstar, where he started gaining popularity in Germany, Switzerland, and Austria. 
            In 2017, he represented Switzerland in the Eurovision song contest with his song “She Got Me,” to which he finished in 4th.</p>
