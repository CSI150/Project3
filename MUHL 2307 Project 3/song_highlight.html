            <h2>Sound:</h2>
            <p>At the beginning of the song there is a legato guitar that is played to the rhythm of the song. 
                When Hanni starts singing, an electronic rhythm is added onto the song, which remains consistent 
                until the bridge of the song. At the bridge of the song, the sound of rhythmic clapping is added 
                on to the sound, before adding a kemenche in the dance break in order to add another layer. 
                When the next verse starts, this entire sequence repeats until after the second dance break. 
                In the interlude of the song, all of the sound is stripped except the rhythm, with the occasional 
                addition of Swiss yodeling added to the end of each line. At the final bridge all of the sound is 
                stripped, except for Hanni’s dolce singing. Then the song adds back the clapping and a muffled 
                sound of the kemenche in the background, before switching back to the sounds in the dance break 
                until the end of the song. These sounds in the song were chosen as a way to combine the different 
                cultures, but also twist them in order to represent a light-hearted and happy feeling.</p>

            <h2>Harmony: </h2>
            <p>Throughout the entire song, it remains monophonic as all of the instruments are supposed to center 
                themselves around both Hanni’s singing and the Turkish instruments during the dance breaks of the 
                song. The song is centered around a singular note because it is supposed to highlight the 
                simplicity of the message of finding that one person that makes you happy. 
                This song is played in the B major key while only switching the focus to different sections of 
                the key. This is to represent not only the light heartedness of the song, but also to represent 
                the almost celebratory part of the song.</p>

            <h2>Melody: </h2>
            <p>The melody is predominantly continuous, with no significant changes to the chord except for the 
                melodic guitar in the background of the song. For the verses, the first part of the bridges and
                the first part of the interlude, Hanni focuses his range in the lower to middle range in order 
                to tie his vocals to the rhythm of the song. However, in the other section of the bridge, 
                interlude, and the dance breaks, his vocals are focused on the higher range in order for his 
                vocals to briefly stand out from the instrumentals as an indirect signal when the instrumental 
                breaks are going to happen.</p>

            <h2>Rhythm: </h2>
            <p>For the beginning of the song, the rhythm is focused on the guitar before switching to the 
                electronic beat. Both of the bridges and the interlude of the song include clapping as part 
                of the rhythm to not only highlight the rhythm of the song, but also to sometimes give the 
                song a double subdivision. Throughout the entirety of the song, it is split into 4 beats with 
                a double subdivision in order to give the song the feel of a faster tempo, especially since 
                this song was created to be a song to dance to.</p>   
                
            <h2>Form: </h2>
            <p>This song is formatted similarly to a pop song, however, instead of a chorus, it is replaced by 
                an instrumental/dance break of the song. Throughout the entire verse of the song, the lyrics 
                are simple instead of having a deeper meaning like some of the other artists in this festival. 
                This simplicity further highlights the light-heartedness of the song, as it is not trying to 
                experiment with a complicated structure to hide any hidden meaning. Instead the simplicity 
                encourages the listeners to enjoy the music itself.</p> 

            <h2>Meaning: </h2>
            <p> While this song does highlight the changes caused by globalization, this song was not created 
                to highlight any issues in the world, nor was it created to in order to represent the traditional 
                culture of a single country. It is instead written to encourage to dance and to highlight the 
                person that mean to them. In an interview with Eurovision Turkey, Hanni states regarding the song, 
                “Every person needs someone who makes them happy and gets the best out of them, that’s what the 
                song means to me.” While some of these other artists perform songs that represent major topic, 
                this song was written in order to entertain the audience, while focusing on their personal 
                relationships in a light-hearted way.</p>
